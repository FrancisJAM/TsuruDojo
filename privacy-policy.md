## Information Collection and Use

The App does not collect any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") from users. However, the App allows users to input and store information about others (such as names, contact details, etc.) on the user's mobile device. This information is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted to the creator or any third parties.

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated above and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time, and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
